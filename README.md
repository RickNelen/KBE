# KBE Assignment

This folder contains the KBE Assignment generated by Nienke van Dam and 
Rick Nelen for the MSc course Knowledge Based Engineering.

# TO DO's:
Nienke:
- Finish the skids and wheels;
- Upload knowledge model to Teams  
- Implement knowledge model for 
    1) placement and sizing of the empennage 
  based on the stability requirements;
    2) placement (and number) and sizing of the propellers based on thrust 
       computations, including one engine inoperative requirements;
 
Rick: 
- Finish the fuselage (including doors) and propellers;
- Implement knowledge model for fuselage and wing sizing;
- Create interfaces for:
    1) Input files: .txt
    2) Analysis: AVL
    3) Output files: .stp and .pdf

# Folder content

The folder 'airfoils' contains the coordinate files for several airfoils.
Note that the name of an airfoil shall be at least 6 characters long; 
otherwise the code treats it as a NACA profile.

The folder 'input files' contains the input given by the user for the 
programme. # NOTHING AT THE MOMENT YET

The folder 'output files' contains the output generated by the programme. # 
Right now it contains a .stp file with the complete assembly.

The file test.py is used to visualise the geometry and may later be changed 
to a different name.

The code itself is located in the folder 'pav_classes':
- __init__.py is used to handle all imports (those imports need to be 
  arranged properly at a later stage);
- airfoil.py contains the class Airfoil, which returns a curve based on the 
  name of the airfoil, the chord length and a thickness parameter;
- fuselage.py contains the class Fuselage, which returns a surface based on 
  curves. The geometry depends on various input parameters and curves 
  defined in attributes containing the 'locations' (it might be easiest to 
  view the properties of these curves if you create splines in Matlab or 
  Python in a similar manner). The surface can also be replaced by a solid 
  if preferred. For now there are two versions of it; one that is directly 
  visible through the parapy GUI and one that is commented out;
- lifting_surface.py contains the class LiftingSurface, which returns a 
  wing-like surface defined by several curves. Each curve can be given its 
  own profile, such that the wing can be made up of various sections with 
  different shapes;
- pav.py contains the class PAV, which returns the assembly. This class 
  also contains the flight conditions, some of which are not complete yet. 
  Based on these flight conditions, it loads parts and overwrites the 
  default inputs;
- propeller.py contains the class Propeller, which returns a single 
  'assembly' of propeller elements, i.e. all the blades, the hub and 
  (eventually also) the nacelle. Note that it is not working properly yet 
  because of the scaling w.r.t. global reference system;
- propeller_blade.py and propeller_nacelle.py might not be used in the end; 
  instead the entire assembly will just be created in the propeller class. 
  However, the nacelle might be useful to have in a separate class such 
  that we can create it only when necessary (i.e. on the wing for a forward 
  facing propeller);
- reference_frame.py is meant to place the assembly inside a reference 
  frame such that it is always properly visualised. At the moment it is not 
  being used yet;
- skids.py is the file where the class for the skids is supposed to be;  
- wheels.py is the file where the class for the wheels is supposed to be
